# Checksum.java
A checksum program is a software tool or algorithm used to verify the integrity of data. It calculates a checksum, which is a fixed-size string of characters generated from the data. Checksums are used to detect errors that may occur during data transmission or storage, such as data corruption or tampering. This program is a representation for it.
